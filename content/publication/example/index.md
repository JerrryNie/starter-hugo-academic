  Unsupervised question answering is an attractive task due to its independence
  on labeled data. Previous works usually make use of heuristic rules as well as
  pre-trained models to construct data and train QA models. However, most of
  these works regard named entity (NE) as the only answer type, which ignores
  the high diversity of answers in the real world. To tackle this problem, we
  propose a novel unsupervised method by diversifying answers, named DiverseQA.
  Specifically, the proposed method is composed of three modules: data
  construction, data augmentation and denoising filter. Firstly, the data
  construction module extends the extracted named entity into a longer sentence
  constituent as the new answer span to construct a QA dataset with diverse
  answers. Secondly, the data augmentation module adopts an answer-type
  dependent data augmentation process via adversarial training in the embedding
  level. Thirdly, the denoising filter module is designed to alleviate the noise
  in the constructed data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
  outperforms previous unsupervised models on five benchmark datasets, including
  SQuADv1.1, NewsQA, TriviaQA, BioASQ, and DuoRC. Besides, 

  the proposed method shows strong performance in the few-shot learning setting.
